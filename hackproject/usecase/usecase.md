## Business Challenge

Web based applications like Mkdocs, Docusaurus is used to create and share documents in Markdown format. 
It was designed to be simple and intuitive, with a user-friendly interface that made it easy for anyone to create beautiful documents.
Hence, it is popular with writers, bloggers, and developers who loved the simplicity and flexibility of the Markdown format. 

However, users with accessibility needs have trouble accessing the application due to accessibility issues.

Some users reported that the application's color scheme made it difficult for them to read the text, while others found it hard to navigate the interface using assistive technologies like screen readers. 
In addition, some users with motor impairments struggled to use the application's keyboard shortcuts, which were not customizable.

Few tried to address the accessibility issues by making small adjustments to the application design and functionality.

Here we take up comprehensive solution to solve the business challenge of solving the accessibility issues by using Theme Builder's accessibility compatible themes in Markdown pages.
