# Workspace Configuration Instructions

Each participating team MUST submit a GitHub repository for each project entry. These instructions provide the preparation steps necessary to configure a project workspace.  

## General Tools
Since this is a public event where participants from financial institutions will be competing, it is advised that all participants use their personal workstations (personal computers) and personal email accounts when participating in the event. 

Each participating team member should determine which computer they will used as their **Development Workstation**. This should to be a *personal computer* that is not connected to the participants corporate VPN. It should also be a device that is not managed by the participants employer. 

## GitHub
Each team should assign an engineer to take the necessary steps to provision the team's project repository in the [public GitHub environment](https://github.com). 

Participants will need to make use of a predefined submission repository called a boilerplate, or “project template”, to quickly provision projects in a consistent manner.

To ensure a smooth development and submission process for your project, it is important to understand how to provision your GitHub repository. This repository will be required when you submit your project. 

### Create Repository

#### Repo Owner Instructions
The designated person on the team that will own the team's public GitHub repo should follow the these instructions for creating a ``` Team Workspace``` repository from a project template using a Development Workstation:

1. Using a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/) on a **personal computer**, navigate to the [FINOS GAAD Hackathon Template](https://github.com/finos-labs/gaad-hackathon-template).
2. Above the file list, click `Use this template`.
3. Use the Owner drop-down menu, and select the account that will own this newly created repository. **HINT**: It should be assigned to a designated person on the team that will own the team's public GitHub repo.
4. Type a name for your repository, and add a description (optional). **HINT**: The repo name should be same as your event Team Name.
5. Choose to make the new repository publicly visible.
6. Navigate to your new repository.
7. Update the repo to meet the [Mandatory GitHub Topics Criteria](./repo-requirements.md) which is required for a qualified submission. See [Add Topics][6].   
8. Select an Event Challenge: The hackathon offers participating teams one (1) or more competition challenges. Each challenge sponsor has outlined the requirements necessary for preparing a  ``` Team Workspace``` repository. Complete the project workspace configuration steps based the desired challenge:

   1. [Atomic Accessibility Design Challenge](../challenges/challenge1/setup.md)
   2. [Inclusive Contracts: Making Legal Language Accessible Challenge](../challenges/challenge2/setup.md)
   
9. Lastly, [clone the Team Workspace repo][3] to a Development Workstation. 

#### Team Member Instructions
Once the Repo Owner has completed the [Repo Preparation Instructions](#repo-owner-instructions), all other team members can [fork and clone][4] the new repo to their Development Workstations.
