In order to prepare, designers already collaborate with business leaders, product owners, architects, developers, and many others to build a vision for the application that will guide their designs.  Theme Builder, like many other comparable design tools, can help designers realize their visions.  But Theme Builder's unique strength lies in its ability to ensure that the design system that is ultimately defined by its author will meet widely accepted accessibility guidelines.</p> <p>The following sections will describe how designers can leverage key features in Theme Builder to allow their application to be consumed by the widest possible audience of end users.</p>"},{"location":"designers/how-to-configure-fonts/","title":"How to configure fonts","text":"<p>Typography pertains to the differences between different styles of text that create distinct appearances in both physical and digital material.

For example, a designer may begin a design system by selecting the colors, fonts, bevels and border styles (and more!) that are shared amongst an existing product family of their organization or they could blaze a fresh trail as they bring a brand new project to life.  They may also include additional accessibility overlays to support users with specific types of impairments.  This is all part of a design system.</p> <p>As they say, \"the proof of the pudding is in the eating\".  So once an author is satisfied with their design system, they'll want to try it out in their own environment.  The design system can be exported from Theme Builder as CSS or JSON.  This may then be imported into other design tools like Figma or into component libraries or even directly into application repositories.
