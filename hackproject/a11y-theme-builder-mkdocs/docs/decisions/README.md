# Decisions

As a community, we will capture all ```Business``` and ```Architectural``` decisions in the repo folder using a derivative of an [Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Template](./adr_template.md).

## ADR Naming Convention

1. Prefix: ```Name```
2. Suffix: 
   * Architecture Decision:```_adr```
   * Business Decision:```_bdr```
3. File Extension: ```.md```

Examples:

* ```PY-KERI_for_SCIDs_adr.md```
* ```Witness_as_a_Service_bdr.md```
