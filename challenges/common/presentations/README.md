# Presentation Tools
Depending on submission criteria for each Challenge, teams may need to produce slideware to help convey the results of their project. In some cases, such slideware may be instrumental in the preparation and delivery of a `Pitch Video`.

## Challenge 1 Suggestions
Both event tracks (*Design Thinking*, *Hack-the-Code*) require a `Pitch Video`. The challenge sponsor recommends that teams use the [Playback Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rZGvHs2P7DAQhsuU2DDylQQgRlUjdXpD9EbKw3yxOpc) (or the locally supplied version in the `/presentations` folder to capture the results of the Design Thinking excercises to help build a clear and concise `Pitch Video`.

    ```
    $ cd <REPO_FOLDER>/hackproject
    $ cp gaad-hackathon-template.pptx playback-brief.pptx
    ```

where:
    
* REPO_FOLDER: Name of the local project folder on your **Development Workstation** after cloning the ``` Team Workspace``` repository.
