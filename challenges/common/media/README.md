# Project Artifacts
Each project will produce a variety of work products during the hacking period. Depending on the type of work product or the tool used to create it, teams will desire to capture a static instance for retention purposes.

## Visual Collaboration Tools
These SaaS offering require fee-based subscriptions to maintain a web addressable link (URL) to a board. It is **highly recommended** that teams export their work into one of two (2) ways:

1. Export sections of a board into PDF format.
2. Export sections of a board into PNG format and then collected and used as in a Powerpoint file. 

>See [FAQ](../../../FAQ.md) for other options. 

Artifacts of this type should be stored in the `media/board` folder. 

## Videos
Teams may use a variety of recording tools (Zoom, Teams, WebEx, Zep, etc) to generate the required videos of the submission process. While recording can be downloaded and then uploaded into the event submission tool, it is **highly recommended** that teams export their work into one of two (2) persistent stores:

1. Add to the project repo in the `media/videos` folder. 
2. Upload to a personal Dropbox, iCloud, Box, or other cloud based file-management solution.
