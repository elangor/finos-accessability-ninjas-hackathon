## Challenge

You can focus on one user or more user personas and pick the corresponding scenario(s) to work on.

You are free to explore different ways of contract language simplification, findability of coverages, interaction with the contract text and create any features that might help your user personas.

There are no restrictions in terms of interface or channels (for the moment what is already in place is a Wizard, so you can exclude that).

You are encouraged to go through all the user personas profiles and needs in order to get inspired and create a richer experience for all.
