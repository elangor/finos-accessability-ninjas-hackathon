# Workspace Configuration Instructions
## Challenge 1: Atomic Accessibility Design

| Topic | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| Overview | Given the challenges associated with risk compliance for people with disabilities (Visual, Motion, Motor, Auditory, Cognitive/Learning), Atomic Accessibility Design enables designers and developers to establish a round-trip workflow process that traverses from abstract concepts to concrete details. The application of Atomic Accessibility Design concepts towards the development of accessibly-compliant solutions yields consistency and scalability while mitigating regulatory risk. |
| Challenge | Organize a well-rounded team that can leverage new accessibility tools to develop an end-to-end solution that explores novel applications of accessibility technologies for financial services.|

## Update Readme
1. Open the locally cloned repository on your **Development Workstation** using your favorite IDE (i.e. [Visual Studio Code][1], [Atom][2]).
2. Based on track selected, copy the appropriate `sample code` to prime your project workspace within the `hackproject` folder.

    ```
    $ cd <REPO_FOLDER>
    $ cp -Rv ./common/* ./hackproject/
    $ cp -Rv ./challenges/challenge1/* ./hackproject/
    $ rm -f ./hackproject/setup.md
    $ rm -f ./hackproject/.gitkeep
    ```

    where:
    
    * REPO_FOLDER: Name of the local project folder on your **Development Workstation** after cloning the ``` Team Workspace``` repository.

3. Move `README.md` to the `archive` folder. Rename it to `ORIGINAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

    ```
    $ mv -fv ./README.md ./archive/ORIGINAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md
    ```

4. Rename `SUBMISSION_README.md` to `README.md`

    ```
    $ mv -fv ./SUBMISSION_README.md ./README.md
    ```

5. Update new `README.md` according to the Template Instructions therein.
