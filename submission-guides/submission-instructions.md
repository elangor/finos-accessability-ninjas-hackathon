### Concept Playback - Pitch Video
All teams are required to submit a **2-minute** pitch video. 
>Note: judges will not view anything after the 2:00 minute mark

The video should include:

* Name of your project and a brief overview of what it does
* The identified issue and how your project is able to tackle the problem
* A brief demonstration of the prototype and the use of technology/application involved 

Refer to the [video creation guide](./video-creation-guide.md) for instructions on recording your pitch video.

### Well organized GitHub Repo
ALL teams are required to submit a well organized GitHub repository for judging. Please refer to the [repo instructions](./repo-instructions.md).

### Concept Show-n-Tell Video 

Teams participating in the Hack-the-code track are required to submit a **2-minute** show-n-tell video walking judges through their working code. 
>Note: judges will not view anything after the 2:00 minute mark

Refer to the [video creation guide](./video-creation-guide.md) for instructions on recording your show-n-tell video.

### Solution Code

Teams participating in the Hack-the-code track can provide their code base within their GitHub Repo.

### Use Case Story
Successful hackathon participants will demonstrate their story-telling ability. This repository contains a structured document outline (using Markdown) to describe a solution to a problem or idea. It is recommended that participants familiarize themselves with the [sample use-case story template](../challenges/challenge1/usecase/story-template.md).

### Visual Collaboration Board URL
[Design Thinking activities](./design-thinking-artifacts.md) make use of visual collaboration tools that allow teams to work together on virtual whiteboards with a variety of features for real-time interactions. 

Participants may use any tools of their choice as long as their resulting board is easily accessible by the judges. It is recommended that participants use the visual collaboration board tool offered by [Mural](./mural/mural-instructions.md) and refer to the [Mural FAQ](./mural/mural-faq.md).

### Visual Collaboration Board Artifacts
Upon completion of the [Design Thinking activities](./design-thinking-artifacts.md), teams should export their work as either a PNG or PDF to add their artifacts to their [Hack Project](../hackproject/) folder.

### Playback Brief

Teams should utilize the [Playback Brief Template](../challenges/common/presentations/gaad-hackathon-playback-template.pptx) to help streamline the creation of a presentation for their Hackathon project. The template provides teams with a structure to clearly communicate the problem or challenge and their proposed solution or idea.
