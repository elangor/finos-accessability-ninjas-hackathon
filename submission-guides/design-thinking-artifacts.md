## Design Thinking Recipe Instructions
### Design Thinking Recipe
1. Select a team member to create a new Mural Board from this [recipe template](https://app.mural.co/template/a34cb087-9954-487a-810f-65671664f59d/97429e07-5ba1-47e9-91d3-98e668e51d42). Instructions for how to copy this template can be found [here](/submission-guides/mural/mural-instructions.md).

The Design Thinking Recipe is broken down into 2 phases:

* **Phase 1:** Frame
	* Teams should start here if they do not know WHO or WHAT their team is solving for
* **Phase 2:** Define & Ideate
	* Teams should start here if their team has an idea of WHAT they are trying to solve for

### Phase 1: 

#### Step 1:  **Choose a Persona**
As a team, determine a persona that you want to find a use case for. 

> * Which of the following personas do you want to find a use case for for the Theme Builder tool?
* Who will you be creating a solution for?
* Think about how the tool could be applied, which of these personas best fits that application?

| Persona | Description |
| ---- | ---- | 
| Designer | Defines consistent design language components and style. Needs to be able to create accessible styling for content creators and developers with minimal effort. | 
| Developer | Implements design language in software systems that generate content. Needs to be able to create accessibly inclusive renderings with ease. | 
| Content Creator | Utilizes the design language to produce consistently styled content. Needs to publish accessible content without extra steps or effort. |
| Impaired Person | A content consumer with one or more disabilities or disorders. Needs to be able to interact with accessible content to achieve goals. | 


#### Step 2: Brainstorm Activities
Once your team has chosen a persona, brainstorm as many tasks that persona needs to do as it relates to accessibility.   

1. Set 10 minutes on the timer
2. Brainstorm what tasks your persona needs to do? What are their jobs? What activities does this persona do as it relates to accessibility?
3. Discuss your stickies as a team
4. Vote on the most important task and bring this idea to the next activity 


#### Step 3: Scenario Map
Place your top voted task at the top of this activity. Now we are going to breakdown the steps taken by your persona to complete this task. 

1. Spend 5 minutes determining the high level steps that your user performs to complete the task your team has identified. Fill in stickies within the "steps" row
2. Next, as a team, discuss what your persona is doing, thinking, and feeling during each step you have outlined. Add your notes to the board as stickies.
3. Once you have filled in the board, spend 5 minutes and vote on any pain points or opportunities that your team discovered. Try to think of where the Atomic Theme Builder tool might be introduced to *reduce* or *eliminate* the pain point you discovered.
4. Bring the top opportunity to the next activity. 

### Phase 2: 

#### Step 4:  Define the Problem

>Note: the output of this activity will be used to fill out your [Playback Brief](/challenges/common/presentations/gaad-hackathon-playback-template.pptx)

Now it's time for your team to **clearly define the problem** using the framework provided.

1. Individually, start filling out the board. Add your thoughts to each column: WHAT, WHY, WHO, WHEN, WHERE, WOW
	* *Hint* if you completed Phase 1, you should already have the WHO & WHAT identified
	* For the WOW column, think of what positive experience your user would have if you were to solve this problem. 

2. Next, discuss your ideas as a group. If needed, vote on the most important stickies in each column. 
3. Finally, summarize each column into one concise statement at the bottom in the blue sticky note


#### Step 5:  Reframe the Problem into an Opportunity
Now that your team has clearly defined what problem you are trying to solve, its time to reframe this statement into an opportunity statement.

1. Start by taking your summarized WHAT & WHY and place these at the top of the board
2. Next, spend 5-10 minutes individually brainstorming opportunity statements, utilizing the provided "How might we..." structure 
3. Discuss your opporunity statements as a team
4. Vote on the team's favorite to move forward with

#### Step 6:  Visualize your proposed solution
Jumpstart ideation by visualizing how this solution might work.

1. Begin by reviewing the top "How Might We" statement that your team voted on
2. Next, use the template to visualize solutions that would solve for your opportunity statement. You can either brainstorm 8 variations of 1 idea, or use the template as a storyboard and visualize how your user would interact with the proposed solution.
3. Be sure to include notes & visuals within this exercise!
4. Your team should now have a clearer understanding of what you want to build for the Hackathon.
5. Go out and build!

## Playback Brief

### PlayBack Brief
To help you streamline creating a presentation for your hackathon project, we have created a Powerpoint template for you to use.

#### Develop Playback Brief

1. Upon completion of Phase 2, Step 4, teams should take their output from the exercise to fill our their [Playback Brief](/challenges/common/presentations/gaad-hackathon-playback-template.pptx). 
2. Download a copy of the Playback Brief above
3. Following the template provided, fill in information created from your Design Thinking Mural board. 
4. This Playback Brief should be used to produce your 2 minute concept video

## Developing User Stories

It is **highly recommended** that participating teams leverage the [sample use case story template](/challenges/challenge1/usecase/story-template.md) to quickly and succinctly develop a story telling artifact that will meet the expectations of the judges.

### Use Case Story

The objective here is to develop a human readable use case that can be easily consumed by business and technical readers. 

#### Develop Story

1. Make a copy of the provided story template file by replacing USECASE_NAME with the name of the team's use case.
   
   ```
   $ cp ./designs/story-template.md ./designs/USECASE_NAME.md 
   ```
2. Edit the story using the provided outline as a guide. Follow the provided inline template instructions. Feel free to augment the outline as needed. Leverage the `./designs/images` resources as directed. 


## Developing Sequence Diagrams

### Developing Sequence Diagrams

Familiarity with UML sequence diagrams is suggested:

* [What is a Sequence Diagram?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram)
* [Why use UML Sequence Diagrams?](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-sequence-diagram)
* [PlantUML Tutorial](https://plantuml.com/sequence-diagram) 

#### Develop UML

1. Pick a UML design tool (LucidCarts, PlantUML, other). Refer to [suggested tools](./tools.md).
2. Create a sequence diagram image and store it in the `./designs/images/uml` folder. Since diagram are often modified/altered, it is advised that you store the source files used to produce the diagram in the `./designs/src` folder.
3. Sometimes, a single diagram is too busy and would benefit from segmenting the steps into multiple diagrams. If multiple diagram are required, repeat `Step 2` for each required diagram.
